# AGENTS.md

This repository is a decision-aware codebase.  
Humans and agents must preserve intent, not just produce code.

## Purpose

Use this file as the operating contract for agentic work in this repo:

- Preserve architectural intent across changes
- Keep decisions discoverable and enforceable
- Prefer safe, minimal, reversible implementation slices

## Decision System

The decision graph in this repo is:

1. `docs/decisions/**` (ADRs): the source of architectural intent
2. Code annotations/comments: where decisions are anchored in implementation
3. Skills/commands (when present): executable guidance
4. Reviews/checks: enforcement and drift detection

If these layers conflict, ADRs win.

## ADR Rules

- Always check relevant ADRs before non-trivial code changes.
- Add or update an ADR when behavior, architecture, telemetry semantics, or migration policy changes.
- ADRs must include:
  - status
  - date
  - decision-makers
  - context/problem
  - decision
  - consequences
  - implementation plan
  - verification checklist
- Keep ADR index current: `docs/decisions/README.md`.
- For consequential follow-on work, append `Implementation History` in the original ADR and link related ADRs.

## Annotation Rules

For load-bearing or transitional code, add concise intent markers:

- Why this exists now
- What ADR governs it (for example `ADR-006`)
- What future state/migration is expected

Use short comments near the affected logic; do not add noisy boilerplate.

### ADR Annotation Convention (Required)

When referencing ADRs in TypeScript/JavaScript doc comments, use JSDoc `@see` tags.

Preferred:

```ts
/**
 * Observable usage total + caption column.
 * @see ADR-005
 */
```

Avoid:

```ts
/**
 * Observable usage total + caption column (ADR-005).
 */
```

Notes:

- Keep the summary sentence clean and separate from ADR references.
- Use one `@see` line per ADR when multiple ADRs apply.
- Prefer this convention consistently in `src/**`.

## Agent Workflow

Before editing:

1. Identify relevant ADR(s)
2. Confirm constraints and non-goals
3. Choose smallest safe implementation slice

While editing:

1. Keep changes scoped and reversible
2. Preserve backward compatibility unless ADR explicitly allows breakage
3. Update docs/ADR verification checklists as needed

After editing:

1. Run typecheck/build/tests relevant to scope
2. Validate data/reporting parity if telemetry paths changed
3. Record consequential decision history in ADRs
4. When committing, draft messages per **Commit messages (commitlint)** below

## Commit messages (commitlint)

Treat **`commitlint.config.js`** as the source of truth. It extends **`@commitlint/config-conventional`** but tightens **`type-enum`** and requires **sentence-case** subjects (`subject-case`). Do **not** follow generic “conventional commits” examples that assume an all-lowercase subject or extra types (`build`, `ci`, `perf`, etc.) unless this config changes.

**Allowed `<type>` values (only):**  
`feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `refactor` · `style` · `test` · `revert` · `chore`

**Header shape:** `<type>(<optional-scope>)?: <Subject in sentence-case>`

- Prefer **sentence case** after the colon (e.g. `fix: Correct null guard in parser`, `feat: Mount overview shell via overviewShellHtml`).
- Optional scope may be lowercase; keep the overall header within conventional length and style constraints from **`@commitlint/config-conventional`**.

**Body (when using a multi-line message):**

- Inherited from **`@commitlint/config-conventional`**: each body line must be **≤ 95 characters** (`body-max-line-length`).
- Wrap long bullet lines; continuation lines may be indented (e.g. two spaces after the first line of a bullet).

**Optional draft check before `git commit`:**

```bash
# Header only
printf '%s\n' 'feat: Example subject for lint check' | npx commitlint

# Full message (header + blank line + body)
printf '%s\n' 'feat: Example subject

- Short bullet that fits within one hundred characters per line.
- Long bullet wrapped onto the next line with a leading space for
  continuation.' | npx commitlint
```

## Escalation Conditions

Stop and escalate to the user when:

- ADR guidance is missing or ambiguous for a high-impact change
- Two valid strategies conflict with existing accepted ADRs
- A fix requires destructive migration or data loss risk
- Observed payload reality contradicts current normalization assumptions

## Boundaries

- Do not silently refactor “inconsistent” legacy code that may be transitional.
- Do not replace source-specific nuance with false equivalence.
- Do not treat generated metrics as exact model context-window truth; label them as estimates when appropriate.

## Definition of Done (Agentic)

A change is done when:

- Code compiles and checks pass for scope
- Decision intent is preserved and discoverable
- ADRs/index/history are updated when consequential
- Cross-source behavior is comparable without hidden counting bias
